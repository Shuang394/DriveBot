# Why did we make DriveBot?
Our team has identified that around 50% of participants in the Basic Theory Test (BTT) and Final Theory Test (FTT) fail on their first attempt. Our group hypothesised that this may be caused by a lack of non-english practice questions easily available online, and non-english speakers
are forced to pay to go to their respective driving centers to practice. To counteract this, we decided to make a chatbot that can generate BTT and FTT questions in the Singapore's 4 main languages (English, Chinese, Tamil and Malay).
