# Why did we make DriveBot?
Our team has identified that around 50% of participants in the Basic Theory Test (BTT) and Final Theory Test (FTT) fail on their first attempt. 

Our group hypothesised that this may be caused by a lack of non-english practice questions easily available online, and non-english speakers
are forced to pay to go to their respective driving centers to practice. To counteract this, we decided to make a chatbot that can generate BTT and FTT questions in the Singapore's 4 main languages (English, Chinese, Tamil and Malay).

# How does DriveBot work?
Drivebot is an AI chatbot that was programmed with JavaScript and ran on the website https://nemobot-neue-experiment.vercel.app/

The logic and chat generation of the Chatbot was done through Specific prompts and specifications, while Javascript was used to control the logic flow and for the chatbot to retain history of the chat.


Below is the final video submission for our team, which explains more in depth how DriveBot works and demonstrates its functions.
