## Introduction
Team A Star's Winning Hackathon project for NTU's July 2023 "E-Hackathon with chatGPT like technologies"

The Purpose of the hackathon was for teams to work with ChatGPT's API and create chatbots that will solve real world problems.

# Why did we make DriveBot?
Our team has identified that around 50% of participants in the Basic Theory Test (BTT) and Final Theory Test (FTT) fail on their first attempt. 

Our group hypothesised that this may be caused by a lack of non-english practice questions easily available online, and non-english speakers
are forced to pay to go to their respective driving centers to practice. To counteract this, we decided to make a chatbot that can generate BTT and FTT questions in the Singapore's 4 main languages (English, Chinese, Tamil and Malay).

# How does DriveBot work?
Drivebot is an AI chatbot that was programmed with JavaScript and ran on the website https://nemobot-neue-experiment.vercel.app/

The logic and chat generation of the Chatbot was done through Specific prompts and specifications, while Javascript was used to control the logic flow and for the chatbot to retain history of the chat.


Below is the final video submission for our team, which explains more in depth how DriveBot works and demonstrates its functions.

# Additional Work after the Hackathon
During the Hackathon, our group attempted to add in a function where the chatbot will attach an AI generated image to illustrate the question given. But given the time constraint, our group ended up not including it in our final project.


After the hackathon, we were tasked to Investigate and dwell deeper into the Imagine generation, and our conclusion was that AI Image generation was still at it's infancy at the time, and it was extremly difficult to get it to generate anything coherant without a lot of experiment in prompting it. A more deatiled read into our studies can be found in the repository's word dox "AStar".
